# Chi-square goodness of fit AND Chi-square test of independence

## Chi-square test of independence (association)

#### Calculate the standardized residuals

Standardized residuals allow us to see which cells are most influential
and aid in interpreting the meaning of the result. Jamovi doesnâ€™t
calculate those automatically yet. (SPSS does.) We can calculate them
manually. The formula is (observed frequency - expected
frequency)/sqrt(expected frequency). As any standardized score, values 2
or greater are extreme values and should be reported as being
significant contributers to significant tests. Positive scores are
higher than expected and negative scores are lower than expected.

# Food as reward - No
(10-23.6)/sqrt(23.6)
```

    ## [1] -2.799516

``` r
# Food as reward - Yes
(23-14.4)/sqrt(14.4)
```

``` r
# Affection as reward - No
(114-100.4)/sqrt(100.4)
```

    ## [1] 1.357288

``` r
# Affection as reward - Yes
(48-61.6)/sqrt(61.6)
